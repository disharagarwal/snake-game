# Snake Game

This is a console-based implementation of the classic Snake game in C. The game allows the player to control a snake and eat fruits to score points. The player needs to avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.

## Features

- Snake Movement: The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- Fruit Eating: When the snake's head collides with a fruit, the snake grows longer, and the player earns points.
- Boundary Collision: If the snake touches the boundaries of the game, the game ends.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it at the end of each game session.
- Previous Scores: The game stores previous players' names and scores in a file, which can be displayed on subsequent game sessions.

## Usage

To run the Snake game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the code using a C compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary to start the game.
3. Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
4. Eat fruits to score points and try to avoid colliding with the boundaries or the snake's own body.
5. Press Enter to end the game.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (such as GCC)

## Note

This implementation is a console-based version of the Snake game and may not have graphical elements. The game is played using the arrow keys on the keyboard and provides a simple and nostalgic experience.

Feel free to customize and enhance the game according to your preferences, such as adding sound effects, levels, or additional features.
